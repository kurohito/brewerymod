# Brewery Mod (Archived)

## 🍺 End of the Road

Brewery Mod is officially being archived and is no longer under development.

It has been an absolute joy seeing this mod become part of so many Stonehearth settlements, but the time has come to close this chapter. There are no plans for future updates or maintenance.

The repository will stay up for historical purposes and for anyone who may wish to fork it.

## 💛 A Huge Thank You

This mod would not have lasted as long as it did without:

- **Wiese2007**
- **Inkraja**

Thank you both for your dedication, fixes, improvements, and for helping keep Brewery Mod running when I couldn’t. I truly appreciate everything you contributed.

And to the community — thank you for playing, sharing feedback, and enjoying it over the years.

Cheers,
**Kurohito** xoxo
